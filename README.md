## KU-DMIS at BioASQ 9: Data-centric and model-centric approaches for biomedical question answering

This repository provides supplimentary data for our participation in the 9th BioASQ challenge. 
The annotation (Data-centric approach) on the training dataset of the BioASQ Challenge 8b is provided as TSV/MS excel format with example code to read the data.
Source code and models for factoid and yesno questions are available on the repogitory for our previous participations (7th and 8th; please see Quick Links section).
